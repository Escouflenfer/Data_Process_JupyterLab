# Data_Process_JupyterLab
@version release-1.3 @date 25.04.2024
<p>Jupyter Notebook used for data visualization and data treatment of X-Ray-Diffraction (XRD), scanning Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX).</p>
<p>Start by executing in a terminal <code>bash./install.sh</code> to install python libraries and the ipywidget module for JupyterLab. A version of python (3.10 or higher) is needed to run the script since it is using the <code>pip</code> command to install dependancies. You can also execute the code direclty in the Jupyter Notebook if you prefer.</p>

<p>Common issues: If you have multiple versions of python installed on your computer, you can execute <code>#python3.X -m ipykernel install --user</code> with <code>3.X</code> to change the JupyterLab kernel to the corresponding version on python.</p>
